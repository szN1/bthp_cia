# bthp_cia

copied off a julius assange expose thingy but with some changes of my own cuz no multiple kernel support when I found this. This is like a cold war era cia written keylogger/listener which sadly requires a live manual listener to make sense.
Now I would make another clean compiler alongside to actually compile the words wriiten sensing the spaces and spacebar triggers but c'mon that valorant rank won't climb on it's own.

and now for the only question in this .txt:
are you so perverted that you'd use a cold war era key listener before actually talking to another wahman?
